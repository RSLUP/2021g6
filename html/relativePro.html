<p id="HeadSP">Relative pronouns</p>




<p id = "Topic1">The relative pronouns are:</p>

<div id="table3">
    <table>
    <tr>
        <th>Subject</th>
        <td>who</td>
        <td>who/whom</td>
        <td>whose</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Object</th>
        <td>which</td>
        <td>which</td>
        <td>whose</td>
       
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Possessive</th>
        <td>that</td>
        <td>that</td>
        <td>-</td>
       
    </tr>
   
    </table></div>

    <p id = "Topic1">We use relative pronouns to introduce relative clauses. Relative clauses tell us more about people and things:</p>
    
    <div id="list1">
        <ul>
            <li>Lord Thompson, who is 76, has just retired.</li>
            <li>This is the house which Jack built.</li>
            <li>Marie Curie is the woman that discovered radium.</li>
        </ul>
        
    </div>
<p id = "Topic1">We use:</p>

<div id="list1">
    <ul>
        <li>who and whom for people</li>
        <li>which for things</li>
        <li>that for people or things.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <p id = "TopicPP">Two kinds of relative clause</p><br>
    <p id = "Topic1">1.  We use relative clauses to make clear which person or thing we are talking about:</p>

    <div id="list1">
        <ul>
            <li>Marie Curie is the woman who discovered radium.</li>
            <li>his is the house which Jack built.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
    
        <p id = "Topic1">In this kind of relative clause, we can use that instead of who or which:</p>

        <div id="list1">
            <ul>
                <li>Marie Curie is the woman that discovered radium.</li>
                <li>This is the house that Jack built.</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <p id = "Topic1">We can leave out the pronoun if it is the object of the relative clause:</p>

            <div id="list1">
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the house that Jack built. (that is the object of built)</li>
                </ul>
                </div>

     <p id = "Topic1">The relative pronoun is the subject/object of the relative clause, so we do not repeat the subject/object:</p>

                <div id="list1">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Marie Curie is the woman who she discovered radium.</li>
                        <li>(who is the subject of discovered, so we don't need she)</li><br>
                        <li>This is the house that Jack built it.</li>
                        <li>(that is the object of built, so we don't need it)</li>
                    </ul>
                    </div>

    <p id = "Topic1">2.  We also use relative clauses to give more information about a person, thing or situation:</p>

        <div id="list1">
             <ul>
                <li>Lord Thompson, who is 76, has just retired.</li>
                <li>We had fish and chips, which I always enjoy.</li>
                <li>I met Rebecca in town yesterday, which was a nice surprise.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    <p id = "Topic1">With this kind of relative clause, we use commas (,) to separate it from the rest of the sentence.</p>

    <p id = "TopicPP">Whose and Whom</p><br>
    <p id = "Topic1">We use whose as the possessive form of who:</p>

    <div id="list1">
        <ul>
            <li>This is George, whose brother went to school with me.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        <p id = "Topic1">We sometimes use whom as the object of a verb or preposition:</p>

        <div id="list1">
            <ul>
                <li>This is George, whom you met at our house last year.</li>
                <li>(whom is the object of met)</li><br>
                <li>This is George’s brother, with whom I went to school.</li>
                <li>(whom is the object of with)</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <p id = "Topic1">but nowadays we normally use who:</p>

            <div id="list1">
                <ul>
                    <li>This is George, who you met at our house last year.</li>
                    <li>This is George’s brother, who I went to school with.</li>
                </ul>
                </div>
<p id = "TopicPP">Relative pronouns with prepositions</p><br>
 <p id = "Topic1">When who(m) or which have a preposition, the preposition can come at the beginning of the clause:</p>
            
                <div id="list1">
                    <ul>
                        <li>I had an uncle in Germany, from who(m) I inherited a bit of money.</li>
                        <li>We bought a chainsaw, with which we cut up all the wood.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </div>
            
 <p id = "Topic1">or at the end of the clause:</p>
            
                    <div id="list1">
                        <ul>
                            <li>I had an uncle in Germany, who(m) I inherited a bit of money from.</li>
                            <li>We bought a chainsaw, which we cut all the wood up with.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </div>
 <p id = "Topic1">But when that has a preposition, the preposition always comes at the end:</p>
            
     <div id="list1">
                            <ul>
                                <li>I didn't know the uncle that I inherited the money from.</li>
                                <li>We can't find the chainsaw that we cut all the wood up with.</li>
                            </ul>
                            </div>
    <p id = "TopicPP">When and Where</p><br>
    <p id = "Topic1">We can use when with times and where with places to make it clear which time or place we are talking about:</p>
                                       
            <div id="list1">
                    <ul>
                        <li>England won the World Cup in 1966. It was the year when we got married.</li>
                        <li> remember my twentieth birthday. It was the day when the tsunami happened.</li><br>
                        <li>Do you remember the place where we caught the train?</li>
                        <li>Stratford-upon-Avon is the town where Shakespeare was born.</li>
                    </ul>
             </div>
                                       
<p id = "Topic1">We can leave out when:</p>
                                       
                <div id="list1">
                        <ul>
                        <li>England won the World Cup in 1966. It was the year we got married.</li>
                        <li>I remember my twentieth birthday. It was the day the tsunami happened.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </div>
    <p id = "Topic1">We often use quantifiers and numbers with relative pronouns: </p>

    <div id="table3">
        <table>
        <tr>
            <td>all of which/whom</td>
            <td>most of which/whom</td>
            <td>many of which/whom</td>

        <tr>
            <td>one of which/whom</td>
