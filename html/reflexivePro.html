<p id="HeadSP">Reflexive pronouns</p>




<p id = "Topic1">The reflexive pronouns are:</p>

<div id="table3">
    <table>
    <tr>
        <th>singular:</th>
        <td>myself</td>
        <td>yourself</td>
        <td>himself</td>
        <td>herself</td>
        <td>itself</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>plural:</th>
        <td>ourselves</td>
        <td>yourselves</td>
        <td>themselves</td>
       
    </tr>
   
    </table></div>

    <p id = "Topic1">We use a reflexive pronoun as a direct object when the object is the same as the subject of the verb:</p>
    
    <div id="list1">

    
        <ul>
            <li>I fell over and hurt myself.</li>
            <li>Be careful with that knife. You might cut yourself.</li>
        </ul>
        
</div>
<p id = "Topic1"> We can use a reflexive pronoun as direct object with most transitive verbs, but these are the most common:</p>
    
    <div id="table2">
        <table>
        <tr>
            <td>amuse</td>
            <td>enjoy</td>
            <td>kill</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>blame </td>
            <td>help</td>
            <td>prepare</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>cut</td>
            <td>hurt</td>
            <td>satisfy</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>dry</td>
            <td>introduce</td>
            <td>teach</td>
        </tr>
        </table></div>

<p id = "Topic1">We do not use a reflexive pronoun after verbs which describe things people usually do for themselves:</p>
<div id="list1">

    
        <ul>
            <li>He washed in cold water.</li>
            <li>He always shaved before going out in the evening.</li>
            <li>Michael dressed and got ready for the party.</li>
        </ul>
        
</div>

<p id = "Topic1">We only use reflexives with these verbs for emphasis:</p>
<div id="list1">

    
        <ul>
            <li>He dressed himself in spite of his injuries.</li>
            <li>She’s old enough to wash herself.</li>
        </ul>
        
</div>

<p id = "Topic1">We use reflexive pronouns as an indirect object when the indirect object is the same as the subject of the verb:</p>
<div id="list1">

    
        <ul>
            <li>Would you like to pour yourself a drink?</li>
            <li>We’ve brought ourselves something to eat.</li>
        </ul>
        
    </div>

    <p id = "Topic1">We use reflexive pronouns as the object of a preposition when the object is the same as the subject of the verb:</p>
<div id="list1">

    
        <ul>
            <li>They had to cook for themselves.</li>
            <li>He was feeling very sorry for himself.  </li>
        </ul>
        
    </div>

    <p id = "Topic1">but we use object pronouns, not reflexives, after prepositions of place:</p>
<div id="list1">

    
        <ul>
            <li>He had a suitcase beside him. (NOT himself)</li>
            
        </ul>
        
    </div>

    <p id = "Topic1">and after with when it means accompanied by:</p>
<div id="list1">

    
        <ul>
            <li>She had a few friends with her. (NOT herself)</li>
           
        </ul> 
    </div>
    <p id = "Topic1">We use reflexives with the preposition by:</p>
    <div id="list1">

        <ul>
            <li>to show that someone did something without any help:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The children got dressed by themselves.</li>
                <li>I prepared the whole meal by myself.</li>
                  
            </ul>
            <li>to show that someone was alone:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>He lived by himself in an enormous house.</li>
                <li>She walked home by herself.</li>
                   
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p id = "Topic1">We use reflexive pronouns intensively to emphasise the person or thing we are referring to:</p>

    <div id="list1">
        <ul>
            <li>Kendal itself is quite a small town.</li>  
        </ul> 
    </div>
    <div id="list1">
        <ul>
            <li>especially if we are talking about someone very famous:</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>Sir Paul McCartney himself sang the final song.</li>
            </ul> 
        </ul> 
    </div>
    <p id = "Topic1">We often put the reflexive pronoun at the end of the clause when we are using it intensively for emphasis:</p>

    <div id="list1">
        <ul>
            <li>I baked the bread myself.</li> 
            <li>She mended the car herself.</li>  
        </ul> 
    </div>
    <p id = "Topic1">Some verbs change their meaning slightly when they have a reflexive pronoun as direct object:</p>
    <div id="list1">
        <ul>
            <li>Would you like to help yourself to another drink?</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>Would you like to take another drink?</li>
            </ul> 
            <li>I wish the children would behave themselves.</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>I wish the children would behave well.</li>
            </ul> 
            <li>He found himself lying by the side of the road.</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>He was surprised when he realised that he was lying by the side of the road.</li>
            </ul> 
            <li>I saw myself as a famous actor.</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>I imagined that I was a famous actor.</li>
            </ul> 
            <li>She applied herself to the job of mending the lights.</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>She worked very hard to mend the lights.</li>
            </ul> 
            <li>He busied himself in the kitchen.</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>He worked busily in the kitchen.</li>
            </ul> 
            <li>I had to content myself with a few euros.</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>I had to be satisfied with a few euros.</li>
            </ul>
